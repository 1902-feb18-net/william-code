@*we do Views in ASP.NET MVC with CSHTML files
    that contain both "razor syntax" and HTML
    the Razor syntax is compiled when the view needs to be rendered into proper HTML
    raxor comments look like this*@
@* below is a "Razor block where it switches to full C# mode*@
@{
    //comment
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
